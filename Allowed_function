fork: Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process
execve: Executes a program, replacing the current process
waitpid: Waits for a child process to change state
kill: Sends a signal to a process
signal: Handles signal processing

File Descriptors and Duplication:

dup: Creates a copy of a file descriptor
dup2: Creates a copy of a file descriptor with a specified new descriptor number
pipe: Creates a unidirectional data channel for interprocess communication

File and Directory Operations:

chdir: Changes the current working directory
access: Checks file accessibility
stat: Gets file status
opendir: Opens a directory stream
readdir: Reads a directory entry
closedir: Closes a directory stream
read: Reads from a file descriptor
write: Writes to a file descriptor
close: Closes a file descriptor
fcntl: Manipulates file descriptor

Networking Functions:

socket: Creates an endpoint for communication
socketpair: Creates a pair of connected sockets
accept: Accepts a connection on a socket
listen: Marks socket as accepting connections
bind: Binds a socket to an address
connect: Initiates a connection on a socket
send: Sends data on a socket
recv: Receives data from a socket
getaddrinfo: Gets address information
freeaddrinfo: Frees address information structure
getsockname: Gets socket name
getprotobyname: Gets protocol entry
setsockopt: Sets socket options

Network Byte Order Conversion:

htons: Host to network byte order (short)
htonl: Host to network byte order (long)
ntohs: Network to host byte order (short)
ntohl: Network to host byte order (long)

Event Monitoring:

select: Monitors multiple file descriptors
poll: Monitors multiple file descriptors (more scalable than select)
epoll_create: Creates an epoll instance
epoll_ctl: Controls epoll instance
epoll_wait: Waits for events on epoll instance
kqueue: BSD/macOS event notification interface
kevent: Registers events with kqueue

Error Handling:

strerror: Returns string describing error code
gai_strerror: Returns string describing getaddrinfo error
errno: System error number
