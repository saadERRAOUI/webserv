the comminucation between two proccess on a network facilited  by sockets.

bind  a socket with port named this operation called  "assigning a name to a socket"

htons() converts it to network byte order. if the host is little-endian the value of sinaddress will be deference
else it's big endian still the same. so we use this function to convert the value from the host byte order to network byte order.
summary :
htons for port and htonl for ip address.
