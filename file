Suggested corrected code snippet for headers:
Replace this part:

cpp
Copy
Edit
for (std::map<std::string, std::string>::iterator it = tmp_map.begin(); it != tmp_map.end(); it++)
{
    response += it->first;
    response += ": ";
    response += it->second;
    response += "\r\n";
}
with something like:

cpp
Copy
Edit
// Example response headers:
response += "Content-Type: text/html\r\n";
response += "Content-Length: " + tostring((int)rt.size()) + "\r\n";
response += "Connection: close\r\n";  // or keep-alive if needed
response += "\r\n";
response += rt;
Why?
Response headers need to describe the response, not echo the request headers.

The Content-Length must match the body size.

Content-Type should be set according to the error page content (usually text/html).

Connection header depends on your server's behavior.

Other headers like Date, Server can be added as well.

Summary
Your function currently echoes request headers as response headers which is not valid HTTP behavior. Instead, build the response headers yourself based on the response you want to send.

If you want, I can help you refactor the full ErrorBuilder function with proper response headers! Would you like me to do that?
